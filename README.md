## Genomic Applications in Sustainable Aquaculture

Genomics continues to play a key role in facilitating sustainable aquaculture. Emphasis will be placed on innovative work in the domain of shellfish genomics, specifically investigations into oyster resilience and adaptability to environmental changes, along with the study of epigenetic modifications that influence the adaptive responses of aquaculture species to varying conditions, holding potential for industry growth. Additionally, broader implications of genomic applications in aquaculture we will explored, such as enhancing disease resistance, controlling reproductive maturation, and precision breeding. Amid global climate change and rising food demands, the integration of genomics and aquaculture is an important component to ensure to global food security and environmental sustainability.
